# Guitar Pedal App
#### This project is a mobile application written in React Native as a companion app to go along with a custom-built guitar effects pedal that utilizes PureData. PureData allows for user-created custom effects and this project attempts to allow them to be imported into this React Native application, saved, and then sent to the pedal. The specifications of this pedal are located on Hackaday.io here:
